# Monique Blignaut Online Portfolio

This website, built in 2024, was born out of the desire to build something fun using technologies or processes I was not super familiar with at the time. I had a specific project in mind at work that I thought could benefit from using these new technologies, and in the end they were in fact used for that project. The main technologies tested were:
1. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): I had heard a lot about Tailwind so wanted to see what the hype was about.
2. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): For some time I had been aware that Vite was the new industry standard on new Vue 3 projects, so I wanted to become familiar with it before pushing to change for Vite over Webpack in new Vue 3 projects.
3. [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/): I wanted to leverage ChatGPT for speeding up the process of writing the logic for the main feature of the site, which are ther interactive "fridge magnets" on the landing page. 

## Technologies
* Vue.js (composition API, script setup)
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* CSS
* HTML

## Development Process
### Visual Elements
I made the visual elements using Adobe Illustrator. I exported majority of these elements as SVGs and used the SVG code directly to be able to manipulate the elements in code and avoid having to make multiple colour variations of each. This control also allowed me to add nice touches like changing the element colours on hover states (eg. logo, icons, filter tags, buttons). The style of the "fridge magnet" elements set the tone for the overall design on the site as I tried to keep in line with the 3D effect and playfulness of the colours and fonts. 

### Interactive "fridge magnets" feature
With the purpose of leveraging ChatGPT with this feature, I spend a lot of time in back and forth 'conversation' and testing. It was essential to have an understanding of the code, as the chat bot almost never generated the functions completely correctly even after attempting tospecifically target the problem areas in various ways. The initial prototypes were done on a small and generic scale with simple boxes in an outlined drag and drop zone, with the later implementation of the trash zones and the generation zones. A number of manual corrections and adjustments needed to be made along the way to get it working the way I invisioned and remove bugs. Once I was happy with these functions I replaced the boxes with a few alphabet SVGs and proceeded to debug the size/scale issues that often come with SVGs. The position and scale of the magnet elements was challenging to get right over a variety of screen sizes, and there was a lot of experimentation involved in this regard.


## Takeaways
I really enjoyed "being the client" on this site and doing things without restraint. It also felt rewarding to be able to go back to work with first hand knowledge on how these tested technologies work and how they might benefit upcoming projects. There was an initial learning curve with Tailwind and Vite but, as is always true, you just read the documentation and keep trying until it becomes more familiar and starts to feel like second nature. I was very impressed with Tailwind in particular and had many "oh cool!" moments out loud when I realised all that it was cabable of. It really sped up my styling process and I loved the ability to extend and/or customise almost every aspect of it with ease.
