      <p class="paragraph pb-paragraph">
        My name is Monique Blignaut. I am a Frontend Software Developer from Durban, South Africa -
        now living in Cape Town, South Africa. Since January 2022 I have been working full-time
        (remote) for a Durban based company called Nologo Studios.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph pb-paragraph">
        I have lived a variety of life and career experiences and I believe each of them has made a
        unique contribution to my work ethic and how I solve problems. I graduated from the
        University of Pretoria in 2013 with a distinction in Information Design (BA). During my
        studies, design thinking was always key to anything we produced. That approach really
        resonated with me and encouraged me to expand my mind by leaving my South African bubble for
        close to a decade. Instead of diving straight into an industry after leaving university I
        chose to explore, work and live in different parts of the world in diverse work
        environments. For me, those experiences have been invaluable as each new experience proposed
        unique challenges that I overcame in unique ways.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph pb-paragraph">
        Fast forward to 2024, I settled into an industry that is also constantly changing, growing
        and proposing new challenges. As a Frontend Software Developer I am still eager to explore
        possibilities and to come up with purposeful solutions to unique problems. I find myself
        most fulfilled when I am working on something that will really make a difference in
        somebody's life and where time has been taken to truly understand and solve the unique
        problem at hand.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph mb-4">
        Outside of software development I am an adventurous nature enthusiast who enjoys traveling,
        hiking, long exposure photography, sports (bouldering, soccer, rugby, netball, softball,
        athletics) and gaming.
