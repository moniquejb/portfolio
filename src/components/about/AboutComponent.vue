      <p class="paragraph pb-paragraph">
        My name is Monique Blignaut. I am a Frontend Software Developer from Durban, South Africa -
        now living in Cape Town, South Africa. I currently work full-time for a company called
        TourAxis.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph pb-paragraph">
        I have lived a variety of life and career experiences, each of which has shaped my work
        ethic and the way I approach problem-solving. I graduated from the University of Pretoria in
        2013 with a distinction in Information Design (BA). During my studies, design thinking was
        always central to everything we created and that mindset really stuck with me. It inspired
        me to leave my South African bubble and spend close to a decade exploring, working, and
        living in different parts of the world. Rather than going straight into an industry after
        university, I chose to broaden my perspective by immersing myself in diverse work
        environments abroad. Each new experience presented unique challenges and overcoming them
        taught me to think creatively, adapt quickly, and stay open to possibility.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph pb-paragraph">
        Fast forward to today, I've found my place in an industry that's constantly evolving and
        full of fresh challenges. As a frontend software developer, I'm still driven by curiosity
        and a desire to create purposeful solutions to meaningful problems. I feel most fulfilled
        when working on something that genuinely improves someone's life, especially when care has
        been taken to deeply understand the problem first.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph mb-4">
        Outside of development, I'm an adventurous nature enthusiast who loves traveling, hiking,
        long-exposure photography, board games, and sports like bouldering, soccer, rugby, netball,
        softball, and athletics.
